Hello World
===========

This is a demonstration of FabIL code for various basic features of the
fabric system, playing on the idea of every programmer's favorite
program. It allows a user to create, read, and push messages stored on a
persistent storage server.

The code is intended to demonstrate how to write FabIL code, including
both the nice distributed programming support as well as issues to keep
in mind to avoid potential pitfalls.

This directory contains the following sub-directories:

  - src/fabil: source code for the example, written in FabIL
  - bin: a collection of scripts for running the example
  - etc: configuration files for the example's store and worker


Using
-----
This example comes with a store named "store" for storing persistent
data, and a worker named "worker" to run the computation.

  0. Begin in the hello example directory and compile the example:

        $ cd $FABRIC/examples/hello-fil
        $ ant

  1. Start the store in a terminal.

        $ bin/start-store

  2. Start the workers in other terminals.
     Worker 1:
        $ bin/start-worker
     Worker 2:
        $ bin/start-worker2

  3. After you're done, exit the store and workers with the "exit"
     command in its console (you can also use CTRL-D).

     You can clean up the store's persistent state by removing the 'var'
     directory:

        $ rm -rf var

Once the store and workers are running, you can run the Hello program
(in src/fabil/Hello.fil) to create messages,

	worker> Hello create title "message contents"
	Message created.

	worker>

Read messages,

	worker>  Hello read title
	Reading message title
	Contents: (Accessed 1 times): message contents

	worker>

And push them to the terminal of another worker

	On worker:
	worker> Hello send title worker2
	Message sent

	worker>

	On worker2:
	worker2> Message contains (Accessed 2 times): message contents

Note: it may be the case that the nodes keys are out of date when you
run this, which will cause the nodes to crash on start.
To create new keys, first remove the old keys under
$FABRIC/examples/hello-fil/etc/keys/. Then run the following:
	1. Create the store key
		# $FABRIC/bin/create-node --app-home $FABRIC/examples/hello-fil --name store
	2. Create the worker key
		# $FABRIC/bin/create-node --app-home $FABRIC/examples/hello-fil --name worker
	3. Create the worker2 key
		# $FABRIC/bin/create-node --app-home $FABRIC/examples/hello-fil --name worker2

When asked for a password, use "password" (no quotes) for the default
setting.  If you want to use a different password, make sure to update
the config file for the node under
$FABRIC/examples/hello-file/etc/config/ to include the line:
	fabric.node.password=YOUR_PASSWORD

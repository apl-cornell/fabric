This directory contains a collection of Jif sample programs. These
programs are designed to test the correctness of the Jif
compiler. This means that some of the test programs are intended to
compile successfully, and others are intended to be be rejected by the
Jif compiler. We are working toward having automated test harnesses
to compile these test programs and ensure that they are accepted or
rejected as appropriate.

These test programs are provided in the distribution as a means for
users to learn from small Jif programs how various language features
should (and should not) be used.


Compiling and Running Test Programs
-----------------------------------

First, follow the installation directions in the file $JIF/README,
where $JIF is the root of the Jif installation. Upon successfully
building the Jif compiler, you will be able to compile and run Jif
test programs in this directory.

For example, to compile the Hello.jif program, go to the $JIF/tests
directory, where $JIF is the root directory of the Jif installation
(i.e., go to the directory this README is in), and execute the
following command.

        $ $JIF/bin/jifc Hello.jif

This will compile the Jif program. To run the compiled program, execute
the following.

        $ $JIF/bin/jif -classpath . Hello

which will produce the output
        Hello, the world!

Note the need to explicitly include the current directory in the
classpath. To see what command the jifc and jif scripts are actually
executing, try including the "-v" flag. For example: 

        $ $JIf/bin/jif -v -classpath . Hello

To automatically execute the tests in this directory, make sure that
the Polyglot Test Harness (pth) is on the path, and run the pthScript:

        $ pth pthScript -cp "../classes:../lib-classes:."

See the Polyglot documentation for building the pth tool. Note that
some of the test programs require the external principals to be
compiled (see below).

Principals
----------

Some of the test programs in this directory have Jif labels which
refer explicitly to principals, such as {Alice:Bob}. Principals with
constant names, such as Alice and Bob, are referred to as "external
principals", and are provided primarily to allow easy testing of Jif
programs.  In this Jif implementation, external principals are
represented by classes in the special package jif.principals. For
example, the principal "Dolores" is represented by the class
"jif.principals.Dolores". The test programs that refer to external
principals require the appropriate principal classes to be compiled
and on the classpath.

The directory ./jif/principals contains Jif classes for all
principals referred to in the test programs provided here. To compile
these classes, go to the $JIF/tests directory and compile all Java
files in the jif/principal directory:

        $ cd $JIF/tests
        $ $JIF/bin/jifc jif/principals/*.jif



More Info about Principals
--------------------------

Let's examine ./jif/principals/Dolores.jif, the class for the
principal Dolores.

	package jif.principals;

	public class Dolores extends ExternalPrincipal {
	    public Dolores{this:}() where authority (this) {
		super("Dolores");

		// Dolores allows Chuck to act for her.
		// Note that in order to add Chuck to Dolores' superiors,
		// we need the authority of Dolores, which is captured
		// by the "where authority (this)" caluse on the
		// constructor signature.
		final principal c = new Chuck();
		addDelegatesTo(c);

		// If we were sure that jif.principals.Chuck was
		// already compiled when we compile this class,
		// we could simply use the following code to
		// add Chuck to the delegates list.

		// addDelegatesTo(Chuck);
	    }
	}

Note that the class Dolores extends the class
jif.lang.ExternalPrincipal, which in turn extends
jif.lang.AbstractPrincipal.

Dolores allows the principal Chuck to act for her, that is, she
delegates to Chuck. The signature for the method addDelegatesTo is
found in jif.lang.AbstractPrincipal:
        public void addDelegatesTo{this:}(principal{this} p) where caller(this)

Note that in order to add a principal to Dolores' superiors, the
caller of the addDelegatesTo method requires Dolores' authority, as
specified by the "where caller (this)" clause of addDelegatesTo. This
authority is asserted in the "where authority (this)" clause of the
constructor for the class Dolores.

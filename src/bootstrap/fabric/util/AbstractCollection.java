/**
 * A basic implementation of most of the methods in the Collection interface to
 * make it easier to create a collection. To create an unmodifiable Collection,
 * just subclass AbstractCollection and provide implementations of the
 * iterator(store) and size() methods. The Iterator returned by iterator(store)
 need only
 * provide implementations of hasNext() and next() (that is, it may throw an
 * UnsupportedOperationException if remove() is called). To create a modifiable
 * Collection, you must in addition provide an implementation of the
 * add(Object) method and the Iterator returned by iterator(store) must provide
 an
 * implementation of remove(). Other methods should be overridden if the
 * backing data structure allows for a more efficient implementation. The
 * precise implementation used by AbstractCollection is documented, so that
 * subclasses can tell which methods could be implemented more efficiently.
 * <p>
 *
 * The programmer should provide a no-argument constructor, and one that
 * accepts another Collection, as recommended by the Collection interface.
 * Unfortunately, there is no way to enforce this in Java.

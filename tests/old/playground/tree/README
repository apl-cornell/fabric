This is a simple example illustrating how to create and access a (secret) binary search tree
on a Fabric store. This tree is only readable and writable by the creator (and the store).

====Compiling the tree Example====

Running 'ant examples' in the Fabric base directory will compile all examples
including the tree example.

If only this tree example needs to be compiled, first run 'ant libs' in the
Fabric base directory to make sure all library code is compiled. Then run 'ant'
in the $FABRIC/exampes/tree directory to compile the this example.

====Running the tree Example====

The tree example runs on one store (store0) and one worker (worker0)
The store does not have any persistent application data.

Follow these steps to run this example. The following items should be on the classpath:

a. $FABRIC/examples/tree/classes
b. $FABRIC/classes
c. $FABRIC/rt-classes
d. $FABRIC/src/lib/sif/classes

Step 1. Start a fresh instance of the store0

Running the following command will start a new store for this application:
$ fab-store --name store0

Step 2. 
Make sure $FABRIC/examples/tree/classes is on your classpath, and
Run the following command in any terminal to create a tree at store0:

$ fab --name worker0 tree.Main create

Step 3.
Make sure $FABRIC/examples/tree/classes is on your classpath, and
Run the following command in any terminal to read from the tree just created:

$ fab --name worker0 tree.Main read

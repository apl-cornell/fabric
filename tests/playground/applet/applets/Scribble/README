Scribble is an example of an applet whose class and instances are stored in
Fabric.  Scribble.html uses FabricAppletPanel to load the applet class and
instantiate a new Scribble object on store0.  Scribble2.html loads the instance 
from Fabric. Currently, Scribble2.html must be loaded in a different browser
(i.e. Firefox and Safari) or on a different system since the applets share a VM
and therefore a worker.

0.0  Copy or symlink the Fabric directory to ~/.fabric (or just fabric/etc to
.fabric/etc). This allows the applet to find configuration files and keys
without environment variables, which don't seem to be set in the browser's VM.

0.1. Run 'ant jar' to build the applet jar and create signed jars of the Fabric
libraries.

0.2. Start some stores: 
	fab-store --name store0
	fab-store --name database

1. Compile Scribble.fil
	filc -dumpdeps Scribble.fil

2. Push Scribble classes to store0.
codebasetool export worker0 . store0 Scribble
(note OID of Scribble class)

3. Edit classOid parameter in Scribble.html if necessary.

4. Browse to Scribble.html
(note OID of Scribble instance in Java Console).

5. Edit objectOid parameter in Scribble2.html if necessary.

6. Browse to Scribble2.html from another browser.
	note that changes to the scribble canvas are shared between browsers, but
	only on repaint.

| Overview |
+----------+

This tests the basic functionality of compiling and running mobile code.

It tests:
- Compiling a fabric class and placing it on Fabric
- Compiling a fabric class using a codebase on Fabric
- Running mobile code (i.e. loading a class from Fabric)

It does not test authority-bounded compilation very much. The test mobile code 
is very simple.

+----------------------------+
| Example Code Functionality |
+----------------------------+

Class A references Class B. Each class has a static sayHello method that says 
"Hello from {className}." The main method of B calls sayHello on B. The main 
method of A calls sayHello on A and B.

+--------------+
| Script Usage |
+--------------+

compileB.sh will compile B and store the codebase in the given store in the 
script. 

Usage: ./compileB.sh

compileA.sh will compile A using B from a supplied fabric codebase and store it 
in the given store in the script. 

Usage: ./compileA.sh oidOfCodebaseForB

runB.sh will run B from fabric. 

Usage: ./runB.sh oidOfCodebaseForB

runA.sh will run A from fabric. 

Usage: ./runA.sh oidOfCodebaseForA

| NOTES |
+-------+

fabric/bin must be in your PATH.

All the scripts have default values. You will have to edit them depending on
your setup (see the defs file).
